# vLLM App Image

This image currently builds vLLM `v0.27.1` from source on top of `pytorch-cuda:26.02-py3` (CUDA variant) and `pytorch-rocm:rocm7.14-ubuntu24.04-py3.12-torch2.11` (ROCm variant).

The app-local patches in `patches/` are required for NVIDIA PyTorch `26.02` and `26.03`, whose Torch `2.11.0a0` snapshots do not expose all APIs assumed by vLLM `v0.27.1` after the stable-libtorch migration. In particular, `torch::stable::Tensor::layout()`, the stable `from_blob` deleter overload, and `torch._opaque_base` are missing or incompatible.

Revisit these patches when vLLM moves to Torch `2.12` as its baseline. At that point we may be able to move to a newer NVIDIA PyTorch container and drop some or all compatibility patches.

Older vLLM releases may need fewer changes. Releases `0.22` and older are suspected to work without these compatibility patches, but that still needs to be verified against the Alps CUDA/HPC stack.

## Mooncake (CXI KV transfer)

Both variants additionally install the [Mooncake](https://github.com/kvcache-ai/Mooncake) transfer engine with the HPE Slingshot (CXI) backend (`USE_CXI`, [kvcache-ai/Mooncake#2535](https://github.com/kvcache-ai/Mooncake/pull/2535)). It is built from a pinned tag by `sources/install-mooncake.sh` (which is part of the app content hash) and installed as the `mooncake-transfer-engine` wheel, providing the `mooncake.engine` and `mooncake.store` modules used by vLLM's `MooncakeConnector` and `MooncakeStoreConnector` KV connectors.

Mooncake is compiled against the libfabric installed by the Alps base image (`/usr`), so it always matches the stack's libfabric version and shares a single in-process libfabric instance with the aws-ofi-nccl NCCL plugin. This is deliberate: a second, bundled libfabric would race for the CXI devices and leave one consumer with an empty provider list.

`patches/mooncake/` fixes CXI device discovery in the Mooncake store client, which otherwise comes up without a transport.

On Slingshot, select the CXI transport in the extra config instead of the default `rdma` protocol, e.g.:

```bash
vllm serve <model> \
    --kv-transfer-config \
    '{"kv_connector": "MooncakeConnector", "kv_role": "kv_producer",
      "kv_connector_extra_config": {"mooncake_protocol": "cxi"}}'
```

`device_name` may be left empty; Mooncake auto-discovers CXI devices. The image also ships the `mooncake_master` store service and the `transfer_engine_bench` utility for transport debugging. A single-node CXI smoke test (`mooncake_smoke.sh`) runs in CI for both the transfer engine and the store.
